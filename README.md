LONELY FANS Lily Phillips begs women to ‘send husbands & boyfriends’ to help her bed 1,000 blokes in 24 hours in ‘sad’ new video
LILY Phillips is no stranger to facing backlash, and the adult entertainer has probably heard it all at this point in her career.

The model has already completed the self-imposed challenge of sleeping with 10 men in one day, but has now shared a controversial video as she reveals she now wants to sleep with 1,000 men in just 24 hours.


Meanwhile, others simply labelled the OnlyFans star as "crazy" and "insane" for her plan.

The announcement comes after Lily's stunt of sleeping with 100 men in a day, the aftermath of which was captured by filmmaker Joshua Pieters, who followed her throughout the day.


The documentary prompted viewers to share how difficult it was to watch.

One said: “This documentary is devastating to watch as a human.”

While another said: "The ending just shows the reality of this. Her mental health is shattered. So sad to see horrible."

Lily said on the documentary I Slept With 100 Men in One Day: “It’s not for the weak girls, if I’m honest — it was hard.

"I don’t know if I’d recommend it. It’s a different feeling. It’s just one in one out, it feels intense.

The existing record for sleeping with the most men in one day was set in Warsaw, Poland, in 2004, and is held by Lisa Sparks, who managed 919 men in a single day.

She hopes to limit each encounter to "a couple of seconds at most" to achieve her goal.

Medical professionals and ethicists have raised serious concerns about the physical and psychological risks involved in such an extreme endeavour.
In the situation in which I find myself right now – I can neither laugh nor cry.
